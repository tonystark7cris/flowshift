All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [2.0.0] — 2026-07-22

### Added
- **`.yxmd` Workflow Converter**: New `YxmdConverter` class and `flowshift-convert` CLI tool to convert proprietary visual ETL workflow XML files into Flowshift YAML pipelines. Supports 15+ tool mappings with expression translation, topological sorting, and graceful degradation for unparseable tools.
- **Enterprise Governance Sub-Package (`flowshift-governance`)**: Extracted and expanded data quality toolkit into a standalone package:
  - `scan_pii()` — Detects PII across 12 international patterns (email, phone, SSN, credit card, Aadhaar, IBAN, passport, etc.) with confidence scoring.
  - `mask_pii()` — Three masking strategies: `redact`, `hash` (SHA-256), and `pseudonymise` (reversible labels with mapping). Competitive differentiator vs. Great Expectations/Pandera.
  - `expect_schema()` / `infer_schema()` — Schema contract validation with dtype aliases, nullability checks, strict/non-strict modes.
  - `profile()` — Statistical profiler with cardinality, null rates, min/max/mean/std, and top-N value distributions.
  - `ContractSuite` — Batch contract runner for pipeline audit checkpoints with PASS/FAIL/SKIPPED/WARN/ERROR reporting.
- **Structured Logging**: Replaced all `print()` statements in pipeline engine with `logging.getLogger()` using hierarchical names (`flowshift.pipeline`, `flowshift.engines.pandas`, etc.). Pipeline metrics emitted as structured JSON.
- **Pipeline Execution Metrics**: Per-step timing (`duration_s`), row counts, output types, and status tracking. Metrics accessible via `Pipeline.metrics` after execution.
- **Pipeline Event Hooks**: Four lifecycle callbacks (`on_step_start`, `on_step_complete`, `on_step_error`, `on_pipeline_complete`) for integrating with Slack, PagerDuty, Teams, or any alerting system without adding those as dependencies.
- **Retry/Backoff for Downloads**: `Developer.download()` now supports configurable `max_retries` (default 3) and `retry_delay` (default 1.0s) with exponential backoff. Handles `URLError`, `TimeoutError`, `OSError`, and HTTP 5xx responses.
- **Schema Contracts in YAML Pipelines**: Steps can declare `output_schema` to enforce data contracts as part of pipeline execution.
- **Spark Integration Tests in CI**: Dedicated non-blocking CI job running Spark backend tests on Python 3.12.
- **Security Policy**: Added `SECURITY.md` with vulnerability reporting process, response timeline, and security track record.
- **Contributing Guide**: Added `CONTRIBUTING.md` with dev setup, code standards, testing requirements, and PR process.
- **Architecture Decision Records**: Added `doc/adr/` with template and records for dual-backend architecture and eval() removal.
- **Enterprise Governance Documentation**: New section in `USER_GUIDE.md` covering PII scanning, data contracts, event hooks, OpenLineage integration patterns, and data catalog recommendations.

### Changed
- **Version bump to 2.0.0** — reflects new sub-package, converter, and breaking packaging changes.
- **Development Status upgraded from Alpha to Beta** in PyPI classifiers.
- **Wheel now bundles `flowshift_governance`** alongside `flowshift` — governance features are available without separate installation.
- **Governance tests included in default pytest** via `testpaths` configuration.
- **Backward-compatible shim modules** (`flowshift._contracts`, `flowshift._pii`) re-export from `flowshift_governance` with deprecation warnings targeting removal in 3.0.

### Security
- **Converter uses `defusedxml`** for safe XML parsing of `.yxmd` files (XXE/SSRF protection). Falls back with a hard error if `defusedxml` is not available (no silent downgrade).

## [1.0.0] — 2026-07-04

### Added
- **Automated CI/CD**: Added a GitHub Actions workflow using OIDC (Trusted Publishing) for automated, secure PyPI deployments on new GitHub Releases.
- **Enterprise Edge Case Protections**: Built a background transpiler to auto-backtick column headers containing spaces to support dirty real-world enterprise datasets without syntax crashes.

### Changed
- **Memory Optimization (Pandas)**: The Pandas backend now automatically requires the `pyarrow` multi-threaded C++ engine when loading large CSV files, heavily reducing physical RAM usage and preventing `MemoryError` crashes.
- **Datatype Coercion**: `Join.join` now dynamically casts mismatching datatypes between left and right anchor columns, eliminating strict PySpark `AnalysisException` errors when migrating disparate schemas.

### Fixed
- **Critical Security Fix**: Eradicated an arbitrary code execution vulnerability (RCE) in `Preparation.formula` by removing the insecure `eval()` fallback. The engine is now entirely zero-trust and sandboxed via `pd.eval` or strict `lambda` callables.
- **Spark Architecture (Sorting Death Trap)**: Completely refactored `Preparation.record_id` to utilize parallelized `F.monotonically_increasing_id()` instead of `Window.orderBy`, eliminating massive single-node memory bottlenecks when scaling Spark pipelines.
- **Spark Architecture (Tuple Bombs)**: Injected native `.persist()` boundaries directly into the upstream nodes of `Join.join` to prevent PySpark from redundantly computing the entire historical DAG multiple times during joins.
- **Regex Edge Cases**: Fixed an engine logic gap where Regex capture groups incorrectly counted non-capturing groups `(?:)` in the Spark backend.
## [0.2.0] — 2026-07-04

### Added
- **Enterprise Scalability (Dual-Backend Architecture)**: Added native support for distributed execution on big-data clusters using the new `SparkEngine`.
- **Thread-Safe Context Manager**: Added `Flowshift.backend()` context manager to allow concurrent multi-threading with different execution engines.
- **Dynamic Dispatch**: `Flowshift.set_backend("spark")` now seamlessly reroutes all tool executions down to Spark SQL and Vectorized Pandas UDFs (PyArrow).

### Changed
- All 55 Core tools have been refactored into thin dispatchers to support multiple engine backends without altering user-facing APIs.
- Updated `README.md` and created `USER_GUIDE.md` with complete documentation, tool reference tables, and declarative YAML pipeline configurations.
